# Vanila-GAN
Teamproject Vanila-GAN Group 2.
Team members: Daniel, Jialu, Lasse

# Documentation<br />
#### 22.05.2020<br />
We got in touch by Email,and the created a whatsapp group and a discord Server.<br />

#### 23.05.2020 - 24.05.2020<br />
We created two channel "code" and "weblinks" on discord,in order to share material.Then we started our first call on discord and discussed how to implement gan.<br />
After reading material for one day,we created the repository "vanila-gan" on github and uploaded the example code.<br />

#### 25.05.2020<br />
Since the structure of the example code is already clear,we divided the tasks before training into four pieces:<br />
  
  - 1.dataset(imlement by Lasse)<br />
  - 2.generator(imlement by Jialu)<br />
  - 3.discriminator(imlement by Daniel)<br />
  - 4.random noise and optimization(random)<br />
  
the first deadline is 31.May.

#### 26.05.2020 - 31.05.2020 <br />
Our own tasks has been completed while we helped each other to improve the code. <br />

#### 08.06.2020<br />
The second part is to implent Training.

During the third meeting,we :<br />
   - added Random noise ,optimization and Real/fake data target<br />
   - corrected the random noise<br />
   - corrected the generator function<br />
   - corrected the optimization part<br />


#### 13.06.2020 - 17.06.2020<br />
Train-generator and train-discriminator has been added.<br />
We had our fourth meeting and dicussed to improve the logger function and README.<br />


#### ?<br />
Mission accomplished.<br />
